    "## Part 1: Parts of a Convolutional Neural Net\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of layers in a Convolutional Neural Network:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolutional Layers\n",
    "- Pooling Layers.\n",
    "- Dropout Layers.\n",
    "- Fully Connected Layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. Convolutional Layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are comprised of **filters** and **feature maps**. The filters are essentially the **neurons** of the layer. They have the weights and produce the input for the next layer. The feature map is the output of one filter applied to the previous layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a densely connected layer and a convolution layer is that dense layers learn global patterns in their input feature space (for example, for an MNIST digit, patterns involving all pixels), whereas convolution layers learn local patterns: in the case of images, patterns found in small 2D windows of the inputs called *receptive fields*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This key characteristic gives convnets two interesting properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The patterns they learn are **translation invariant**. After learning a certain pattern in the lower-right corner of a picture, a convnet can recognize it anywhere: for example, in the upper-left corner. A densely connected network would have to learn the pattern anew if it appeared at a new location. This makes convnets data efficient when processing images (because the visual world is fundamentally translation invariant): they need fewer training samples to learn representations that have generalization power.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They can learn **spatial hierarchies of patterns**. A first convolution layer will learn small local patterns such as edges, a second convolution layer will learn larger patterns made of the features of the first layers, and so on. This allows convnets to efficiently learn increasingly complex and abstract visual concepts (because the visual world is fundamentally spatially hierarchical).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutions operate over 3D tensors, called feature maps, with two spatial axes (height and width) as well as a depth axis (also called the channels axis). For an RGB image, the dimension of the depth axis is 3, because the image has three color channels: red, green, and blue. For a black-and-white picture, like the MNIST digits, the depth is 1 (levels of gray). The convolution operation extracts patches from its input feature map and applies the same transformation to all of these patches, producing an output feature map. This output feature map is still a 3D tensor: it has a width and a height. Its depth can be arbitrary, because the output depth is a parameter of the layer, and the different channels in that depth axis no longer stand for specific colors as in RGB input; rather, they stand for filters. Filters encode specific aspects of the input data: at a high level, a single filter could encode the concept “presence of a face in the input,” for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the MNIST example that we will see, the first convolution layer takes a feature map of size (28, 28, 1) and outputs a feature map of size (26, 26, 32): it computes 32 filters over its input. Each of these 32 output channels contains a  26×26 grid of values, which is a response map of the filter over the input, indicating the response of that filter pattern at different locations in the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutions are defined by two key parameters:\n",
    "- Size of the patches extracted from the inputs. These are typically  3×3 or  5×5 \n",
    "- The number of filters computed by the convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Padding**: One of \"valid\", \"causal\" or \"same\" (case-insensitive).  \"valid\" means \"no padding\".  \"same\" results in padding the input such that the output has the same length as the original input.  \"causal\" results in causal (dilated) convolutions,\n",
