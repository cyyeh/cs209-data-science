# README

Since the [course website](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2020-AC295/) is not complete yet, I can't put course material here. However, I've found out that the content of [this repository](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2020-ComputeFest) is a lot similar with the course, according the the course syllabus. So, I clone the content of the repository here.
