# SOLUTION: discussed heavily in lab. in short, shorter trees have less variance and higher bias. the opposite is true for longer trees.
imagine if we had a dataset with 12 features measuring personal attributes, and the target goal is to predict if one is a basketball
player or not. if we had a short decision tree, perhaps it would have 'height' as the root node of a decision tree. surely
there's more useful info than that, and it's wrong of us to assume that all tall people play basketball. thus, it's very biased of us/our model
to think so. moreover, if we were given more training data (simply, more people in our dataset), our tree would likely still pick
height as the same root node, so there's little variance w.r.t. training data.
