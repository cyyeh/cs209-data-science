This was understandable because the WWW was tightly integrated into the only way to access the Internet -- via using your phone line to dial into your Internet Service Provider, then use a browser to \"surf\" the web. The only common non-web content were chat messaging services (e.g., AOL's AIM, MSN Messenger, ICQ) and computer games. Yet, it's truly the \n",

You can read more about it [here](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/). There's always been serious competition amongst browsers as for which would become the most popular. In the 90s, ISPs' built-in browsers were the default, while Netscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) competed for dominance. In 1998, the US Government charged Microsoft for being a monopoly, and its Internet Explorer browser was a cornerstone of the lawsuit.

    "All web pages are just files. Specifically, **each** web page is a particular computer file, typically written in a format called `HTML (HyperText Markup Language).`, that resides on a computer somewhere in the world. All of its included objects (e.g., images, sounds, dynamic scripts that allow for interactive experiences, etc) are separate files. The web page defines how to use, structure, and organize these contained objects. This is just like how a document on your local computer works -- you can have a Word document that contains images for whatever you like. Hopefully that document (i.e., web page) is nicely formatted, has a legit structure without errors, and correctly uses objects (e.g., images) that truly exist.\n",

    "Once a computer has a collection of web pages, which optionally interact and link to one another, how does the common public access it? Doesn't it need permission to access such a machine? Yes, that is what [DNS (domain name service)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) and [HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) are for. Their intricate details are beyond the scope of this course, but in short:\n",

    "  <li>DNS allows one to register a URL address (e.g., www.harvard.edu) and designate which specific computer in the world to access (for web page content) when one points their browser at the URL. It's like a forwarding address. It's useful that we can use human language words as an address instead of just long-winded IP addresses (e.g., 182.91.121.89) anytime we want to access a site</li>\n",
